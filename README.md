Vanguard A/B Testing - Project 2: EDA and Inferential Stats

Introduction

This project involves an analysis of an A/B test conducted by Vanguard, a US-based investment management company. The A/B test aimed to determine if a redesigned User Interface (UI) with in-context prompts would enhance the online process for clients, leading to higher completion rates. Our task is to analyze the experiment results using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Performance Metrics, and Hypothesis Testing.

Project Overview
- Project Title: Vanguard A/B Testing - EDA and Inferential Stats
- Company: Vanguard, USA
- Experiment Dates: March 15, 2017 â€“ June 20, 2017
- Objective: Evaluate whether a new digital interface leads to improved process completion rates.

Datasets Used

- Client Profiles (df_final_demo): Contains client demographics and account details.
- Digital Footprints (df_final_web_data pt_1 & pt_2): Logs client interactions online. The two parts of this dataset were merged for comprehensive analysis.
- Experiment Roster (df_final_experiment_clients): Specifies clients who participated in the experiment and their group (control/test).

Project Structure
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzing the distribution of client demographics and behaviors.
Merging and cleaning datasets to prepare for analysis.

Performance Metrics:
- Evaluating key performance indicators (KPIs):  completion rate, error rate, time spent on each step

Hypothesis Testing:
- Testing whether the new UI leads to significantly higher completion rates.
- Assessing the effectiveness of the experiment design

Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn): Used for data cleaning, EDA, and statistical analysis.
- Tableau: Used for creating visualizations.
- GitHub: Version control and collaboration.

Results
- Control and test group similar in demographics
- Test group performs slightly better on all KPIs
